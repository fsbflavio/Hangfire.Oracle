# Hangfire.Oracle.Core Implementation
This package is an implementation for Hangfire for Oracle.

The idea is to keep it updated with [Microsoft life cycle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet-framework)

Hangfire.Oracle is a fork from [Hangfire.Oracle.Core](https://github.com/akoylu/Hangfire.Oracle.Core). I tried to contact the repository owner but it seems that the repository Hangfire.Oracle.Core is no longer been maintain, so I start a new one here to get updated.

If you want to help to maintain this repo, feel free to create a Pull request.

Upgrade all the Packages.
